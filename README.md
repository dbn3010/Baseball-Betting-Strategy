•	From the above game scenario, we have observed, for the team Boston Red Sox, if matches are first played in New York, the series winning probabilities are lower than 50%. And, if the series starts with the first match in Boston, then Red Sox are having more than 50% chances that they will win the series.  
•	For best of three series, possible net amount values are four i.e. (2000, 950, -1100, -2100).  
•	For best of five series, possible net amount values are six i.e. (3000, 1950, 900, -1150, -2150, -3150).  
•	For best of seven series, possible net amount values are eight i.e. (4000, 2950, 1900, 850, -4200, -3200, -2200, -1200).  
•	Using Chi-squared test we validated that our data distribution of random values are similar to the data distribution of our expected values calculated using respected probabilities.  
•	For series where matches are starting from New York, we are 95% confident that our net win amount will lie in negative values which is not favorable to us. For such series, I will not choose to place my bets on Boston Red Sox team.  
•	For series where matches are starting from Boston, we are 95% confident that our net win amount will lie among positive values. And even though the variation in the data is somewhat high, I would like to take the risk and place my bets on Boston Red Sox for these series.
